          Welcome to Little Lemon, a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant nestled in the heart of Chicago.
          Our journey began with a passion for sharing the rich and diverse flavors of the Mediterranean with our community.
          At Little Lemon, we believe that food is more than just a mealâ€”it's an experience, a connection to tradition, and a celebration of culture.
          Our menu is a tribute to the time-honored recipes passed down through generations, infused with a modern twist to create a unique dining experience.
          We take pride in using the freshest ingredients, sourced locally whenever possible, to ensure that every dish is bursting with authentic flavor and vibrant aromas.
          From our tender lamb kebabs to our crispy falafel, each dish is crafted with care, reflecting the love and dedication we have for our culinary heritage.
          Whether you're joining us for a quick lunch, a relaxed dinner, or a special occasion, we aim to transport you to the sun-soaked coasts of the Mediterranean with every bite.
          At Little Lemon, we treat our guests like family.
          Our warm, inviting atmosphere and attentive service make it the perfect place to gather with loved ones or enjoy a quiet meal for one.
          Come and experience the magic of Mediterranean cuisine, where tradition meets innovation, and every meal is a journey.
